## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).


### Game Objective:

**Match all cards to win the game!**

### Playing the Game:

Try finding the match to any box by clicking on another box.

#### Notes:

This game is to test your *memory*. So try finishing the game with less than *16 moves* to get *3 stars!*

*Be careful*, clicking on the restart will erase all progress made! 

**Just relax and have fun!**
